Trinket M0 Super Mini based annoy-a-tron built into a gag gift! I have chosen to build it in a clear ornament frame, frost the viewing side, and use an opaque paint on the other side to hide the hardware.

Parts:

1 Trinket M0 Super Mini
1 button
1 passive buzzer
X LED's. I used 5mm RGB cycling 2 post LEDs for prettiness
X appropriate resistors for your LEDs
1 1k Î© pull up resistor
650 mAh LiPo with JST
LiPo charger, I used https://www.adafruit.com/product/2124
